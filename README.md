## Fruit As Coding Time - A Manifesto

Software engineering esimates are notorious for being wildy inacurate and waaaay to abstract.  

What's a 3 pointer compared with a 5 pointer?  
Why the hell are we talking about T-Shirt sizes?  
And does it really matter anyway when - in our heads - we are all secretly converting it all, to 'days-of-work'?

All these problems and more are eliminated via the *FACT* system.

## FACT - 101

:grapes: grape - is the smallest piece of work you can do.

:strawberry: a strawberry is the same as a few grapes work

:apple: apple is the same a strawberry plus a couple of grapes

:pineapple:pineapple is at least a couple of apples

:watermelon: watermelon is the biggest piece of work we can do without slicing it up.

## FACT - Advance

If you have personal fruit preferences then switches are allowed (for approximately same sized fruit), you can for example use:

a cherry :cherries: instead of a grape :grapes:

or a pear :pear: instead of an apple :apple:

But for obvious reasons you are not allowed to use a peach or an eggplant

:peach::eggplant:

## FACT - The Future

Why are you still sat there reading this when, your terrible estimates are -  _right at this very moment_ - applying delivery pressure to you and your team?  

You _already_ have enough information to start apply FACT at work **right now.**

When your Product Owner asks how long something is going to take - reply with confidence:

> "we don't do 'how long' here, we do FACT, and the FACT is - that piece of work is a pineapple. 
> We eventually agreed it was a pineapple, even though some thought it was just a grape."

## FACT - Extras

### The Plinth of Deliverence

Next time your team is estimating your next sprint, try this to demonstrate the visual power of FACT in action.

Typically, your team decides how much fruit to allocate to a story:

> "It's at least a pineapple."
> 
> "You think everythings a pineapple!"
>
> "You awlays think it's a strawberry but it ends up being a pineapple."
> "That happened once, ONCE!  Let it go man, let it go."
>
> "We should let _you_ go"
>

The above is a familiar scene to us all I am sure.  

Next time though, come prepared - come with fruit.  As you agree on your estimations, take the actual fruit that corresponds to your estimate and place it in a basket.  This basket can be a regular basket, or if you work in 'The Valley', perhaps you can purchase an advance glass chilling room for you and your team.  

Either way, take you basket and place it on a plynth. This plynth should be referred to as **The Plinth of Deliverence** and should be located somewhere where all your team and interested parties can see it.

I'm sure you are excitedly jumping ahead in your minds right at this moment..... that's right:

### Eat The Fruit Of Deliverence

As each team member completes their story, they get to (or 'must' if you will), approach **The Plinth of Deliverence**, take the corresponding fruit, and eat it.  

If a QA has done absolutely _anything_ of any note, they too get to share the bounty.

### Can We Take More Fruit?

The above becomes easy to answer.

After your Product Owner asks you, for the 100th time, the above question - simply glance at **The Plinth of Deliverence.**

Is it full and heavy with the weight of over optimism?  

Then fuck no, we can't take any more fruit. 

Is it bare and desolate, save for a few rogoue grapes and an apple that everybody is trying to avoid touching?  

Then yes, yes we can take more - and _we want_ more.
