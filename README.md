## Fruit As Coding Time - A Manifesto

Software engineering esimates are notorious for being wildy inacurate and way to abstract.  

What's a 3 pointer compared with a 5 pointer?  
Why the hell are we talking about T-Shirt sizes?  
And does it really matter anyway when, in our heads, we are all secretly converting them to 'days-of-work'?

All these problems and more are eliminated via the *FACT* system.

## FACT 101

:grapes: grape - is the smallest piece of work you can do.

:strawberry: a strawberry is the same as a few grapes work

:apple: apple is the same a strawberry plus a couple of grapes

:pineapple:pineapple is at least a couple of apples

:watermelon: watermelon is the biggest piece of work we can do without slicing it up.

## Advance FACT

If you have personal fruit preferences then switches are allowed, you can for example use:

a cherry :cherries: instead of a grape :grapes:

or a pear :pear: instead of an apple :apple:

But for obvious reasons you are not allowed to use a peach or an eggplant

:peach::eggplant:

## FACT - The Future

Why are you still sat there reading this when your terrible estimates are _right at this very moment_ applying delivery pressure to you and your team?  

You _already_ have enough information to start apply FACT at work **right now.**

When your Product Owner asks how long something is going to take - reply with confidence - "we don't do 'how long' here, we do FACT, and the fact is that this is a  :pineapple:pineapple. We all agreed it was a :pineapple: pineapple even though you thought it was just a :grapes:grape."
